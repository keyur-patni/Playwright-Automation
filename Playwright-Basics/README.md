# Playwright Basics

Foundational Playwright examples covering locators, assertions, and test structure.

This folder includes foundational Playwright automation examples using **TypeScript**.  
It covers essential concepts like locators, assertions, waits, test grouping, hooks, and slow motion recording.  
These examples establish a strong base for understanding Playwright’s core capabilities and structure.

## 🧠 What’s Covered

- Installing and configuring Playwright
- Working with `test`, `expect`, and locator strategies (`getByRole`, `getByText`, etc.)
- Implementing Hooks (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`)
- Grouping tests with `test.describe()`
- Recording and replaying tests in UI mode
- Debugging with `show-report` and step-by-step execution
- Understanding Playwright directory and configuration structure

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Playwright** (TypeScript)
- **Node.js / NPM**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Browsers:** Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

## 📂 Folder Purpose

This folder represents the first step in my Playwright learning path:  
building a practical understanding of **how Playwright tests are written, organized, and executed** before scaling to framework-level design.

## 💡 Next Steps

The skills learned here provide the foundation for building the **POM Framework** and later integrating **API and UI automation** for end-to-end validation.
