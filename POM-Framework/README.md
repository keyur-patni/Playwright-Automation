# Playwright Page Object Model (POM) Framework

Scalable Playwright framework built with the Page Object Model pattern.

This folder demonstrates the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern using **Playwright with TypeScript**.  
The focus is on structuring tests for scalability, maintainability, and readability — simulating how enterprise QA teams organize test automation projects.

## 🧠 What’s Covered

- Designing and implementing Page Object classes for modular test structure
- Separating page actions, locators, and test logic
- Building reusable utilities for test data and common workflows
- Handling environment-specific configurations and test data files
- Integrating assertions and custom reporting
- Applying hooks (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`) for environment setup and cleanup
- Parallel test execution and test organization

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Playwright** (TypeScript)
- **Node.js / NPM**
- **Visual Studio Code**
- **Page Object Model (POM) Architecture**

## 📂 Folder Purpose

This framework represents the **intermediate phase** of my Playwright automation learning — transitioning from simple UI tests to **structured, maintainable test frameworks** suited for real-world QA teams.

## 💡 Next Steps

Upcoming goals include:

- Incorporating **API testing** into the framework
- Adding **data-driven testing** capabilities
- Implementing CI/CD integration for continuous validation pipelines
