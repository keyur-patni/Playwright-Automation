# Playwright API Testing

API automation with Playwright’s APIRequestContext and TypeScript.

This folder includes hands-on API testing examples built with **Playwright** using **TypeScript**.  
The purpose of this module is to demonstrate how Playwright can be extended beyond UI automation  
to validate backend services, perform API assertions, and integrate with functional test suites.

## 🧠 What’s Covered

- Sending `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests using Playwright’s APIRequestContext
- Validating response codes, headers, and payload data
- Chaining API calls and reusing tokens between requests
- Using environment variables for secure test configuration
- Integrating API validations with UI workflows
- Reporting and debugging API test results

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Playwright** (TypeScript)
- **Node.js** & **NPM**
- **VS Code**
- **RESTful APIs**

## 🧩 Folder Purpose

This folder is part of my Playwright learning and demo series:

1. `Playwright-Basics` — Fundamental UI interactions and locators
2. `POM_Framework` — Page Object Model for scalable test design
3. `Playwright_API_Testing` — API testing and backend validation

## 💡 Next Steps

In upcoming modules, I plan to integrate API and UI tests,  
and experiment with data-driven testing and CI/CD pipelines.
